# Self Balance Robot Test Code

Based on a Robot designed by Ray, and code found here:  
https://maker.pro/arduino/projects/build-arduino-self-balancing-robot?utm_source=Maker.pro+Users&utm_campaign=7498c24b57-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_08_27_09_47_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_09aacfcdc1-7498c24b57-280394513  

The original source code has some errors, and all the code needs to be put in one directory named "AmBOT_final_nano".  

The code is "Rays self balancing robot" direcotry made some of the changes needed to compile the above code, but doesn't work correctly with Ray's robot, more work is needed.
